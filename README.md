COVID HERO !
=================
This is my first game written in javascript. Feel free to use it as a template for your own game or use the game assets, which i made myself in aseprite. 
Known bugs are:

 * sometimes the covid hero will shrink when gaining a toilet paper and stay shrunk (somewhat usueful in gameplay actually)
 * sometimes the gaining a toilet paper will cause an exponential increase in covids to appear adn the score to increase infinetly (rare)

Sadly i can't figure out the cause of any of these as they dont bring up any console error.
